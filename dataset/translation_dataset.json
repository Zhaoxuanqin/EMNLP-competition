It will continue to expand. Last year, CS costs have been more than 2 %, which may be higher this year, which will cause great pressure. Therefore, hoping that the Financial Management will agree to borrow a second barrel of gold to give foreign exchange reserve, so that companies will not be dragged by the exchange rate this year. fall.However, Cai Mingxing took the lead in reporting in May, saying that Fubon Life has already had exchange benefits, and a large number of foreign exchange reserves were added. At the end of May, the balance would exceed 14 billion yuan. The balance of foreign exchange reserve reached a new high in history.  Next, if the US interest rate cuts, the exchange cost of the life insurance industry may be further reduced. After the exchange of risk aversion and the loss of the exchange benefits is expected to occur."

C2(中)與C3(遠)分別由中華電與遠傳繼續持有,也就是說,這兩家率先開台的機會大增 C1 由台灣大取得,但此頻帶又有原使用者遠傳電使用到106年6月,這就要等開台後才知使用上的穩定性了, 或是合作?? C4 由遠傳電取得,但此頻帶又有原使用者台灣大使用到106年6月,這就要等開台後才知使用上的穩定性了, 或是合作?? C5 由中華電取得,又是此次的地王段,因為頻段沒有人使用,而且擁有最大頻寬15MHz, 這對開台後的穩定度一定有加分效果,就讓我們拭目以待吧. 目前中華電是持有原頻帶最多的一家,4G初期是可期待的,之後就看經營者的遠觀與策略了.  不對的地方請幫忙更正,不足的地方也幫忙增加!!",0.005476451259583,0.0043668122270740005,-0.00328587075575,-0.006550218340611,1,0,"I don't want to wait.

Except for A4 exceeding 10 billion, the remaining A1 ~ A3 are more than 6 billion yuan, A4 is obtained from Taiwan. It is mainly to see that he is 15M's frequency width, but it will also be relatively hard, because ENB must be re -built  B1 ~ B3 (800MHz) does not have much passion, but with a small change B1 was obtained by Taiwan Star, but this frequency belt also used the original user Asia Pacific to use in December 107. And Taiwan Star only labeled this frequency band, but recently I heard that the two have to cooperate.I don't think I will cooperate in the future. B2 is still held by China Electric (formerly China Electric Frequency Belt, and it is continued to be used by China Electric) B3 was obtained by Guoji. This band was really hodgepodge before July 106. I remember yes, the three farms of Zhongtai can use this frequency band. Fortunately, Guoji also has A3, and the initial operation is not a problem.  C1 ~ C5 is really large killing powder. 3GPP is defined in BAND 4, which is also a frequency band used by many countries (who will use when foreigners come to Taiwan? Therefore, it is a battlefield that each industry must hold. In addition, the original industry (Zhongtai Yuan) operates C1 ~ C4 for a long time, and the C5 is the new frequency band.C2 (middle) and C3 (far) are continued by China Electric and Yuanchuan, respectively. C1 was obtained by Taiwan, but this frequency band was used by the original user's long -term electricity to June 106. This will not be able to use the stability of use after opening. Or cooperation ?? C4 was obtained by Yuan Poor Electric, but this frequency band was used by the original user of Taiwan's Ambassador to June 106. This will only wait for the stability of use after opening. Or cooperation ?? C5 was obtained by China Electric, and it was the ground king section, because there were no people in the frequency band, and the maximum frequency width was 15MHz, The stability after the opening must have a bonus effect, let's wait and see.At present, China Electric is the one with the most original bands. The 4G was expected in the early stage. After that, it depends on the perspective and strategy of the operator.

Xie Jinhe, chairman of Caixin Media, said that in fact, this is the fourth quarter of last year. The season line is 570 yuan.   The 10 -year -old US bond yield broke through 1.614%last week, and fell slightly in a few days, but today it rose nearly 1%, approaching 1. 1.5%mark. The market worried funds will convert off -stock debt, dragging Asian stocks to start a new wave of massacre, from 1.5%to 2.8%, of which Japanese stocks have plummeted more than 800 points, and Hong Kong stocks have plummeted by more than 750 points.  Taiwan stocks opened today and plummeted by more than 371 points, and the lowest reached 15,840 points. Breaking through the 5th and monthly lines, the technical surface was shocked. 20 yuan (or 3..2%), the minimum came to 602 yuan, but fortunately stayed at the 600 city gate.  Xie Jinhe pointed out that the yield of US public bonds has risen, and the global stock market has staged a small stock disaster, as if evoking the global stock market killing around 228 last year. In fact, this is the overwhelming correction of the global stock market since the fourth quarter of last year.  He said that if the yield of public bonds has risen, TSMC maintains a dividend of 10 yuan last year, and its dividend return and 10 -year public debt yields in the United States have been between Bo Zhong, which will inevitably affect the long -term investment value of TSMC and become a significant under the US debt storm. The victim.TSMC has recently become a foreign -funded withdrawal machine. Even if Taiwan stocks rose by more than 250 points yesterday, more than 3,000 TSMC stocks were continued. At the same time, the number of TSMC retail shareholders (as of 2/26) climbed against the trend to 840,000 Essence The legal person pointed out that TSMC's yield rates are indeed low and foreign -funded sales pressure has not been removed. In addition, the increase in the number of retail shareholders has caused a mess of chips, which does not rule out the support for further recovery season lines of 570 yuan.  https://www.chinatimes.com/realtimenews/20210304002820-260410?Chdtv  Xie Jinhe, who shouted to protect the country, has always been optimistic about Xie Jinhe, who has always been optimistic about TSMC  You can’t believe me, but you ca n’t help but believe that Boss Xie Jinhe Xie has spoken, and you can buy it again?  After GG year after year, 500 is not just talking casually","""The Guo Guo Mountain can be rooted at any time!"" Zhu Xueheng, the god of the house, believes that many Taiwanese factions refer to TSMC as the gods of protecting the country. Therefore, Li Guimin, a lawyer and Kuomintang legislator for more than 30 years in the semiconductor industry for more than 30 years. Li Guimin pointed out that in the world, TSMC is indeed the strongest and largest, but it is estimated that Samsung can catch up in a few years. But in addition, the industry is worried that TSMC is the place where danger is most likely to occur.Li Guimin: China wants to develop semiconductors within 10 years. The fastest way is martial arts Zhu Xueheng said that former President of Google Eric Schmidt recently pointed out in Congress that the bottleneck in American science and technology development is in TSMC, but the main force of TSMC is located in the Taiwan Strait, so it may have a great challenge to the United States.(Related reports: Dali Guang's ""purchased"" pineapple, declare the face of the Face Agriculture Committee! Chen Jizhong's revealing truth ｜ More articles)  Li Guimin responded that if the United States saw the importance of TSMC, did China not see it? Everyone is talking about Taiwan. Taiwan is a dangerous place, because the United States and China also want it. In case of the situation, the global IC will be stopped. Especially when facing the epidemic and home economy, when the supply of IC cannot continue, it will become a big disaster.  Li Guimin believes that when China wants to develop semi -conductive technology within 10 years, the fastest way is martial arts and Taiwan, but will the United States let China take down Taiwan?  https: //www.storm.MG / Article / 3511058"

If the net profit in 2019 is 345.3 billion yuan, the compound growth rate of the net profit in 24 years is also 14%(151*1.15^24 = 3505, the net profit in 2018 is 351.1 billion), so 2330 is really an uncomfortable enterprise.The higher the profit amount of the enterprise, the increase in the interest ratio, because people are optimistic, so the stock price increase rate will be greater than the profit growth rate. Where? It's hard to know."

Reuters first disclosed on the 12th that the foundry cooperation plan of Intel and TSMC will be The independent graphics card chip ""DG2"" is first, and the accumulation of 7 nanometers is produced, so that the enemy is fighting against Huida.  Intel is unwilling to comment on relevant reports; TSMC does not respond to market rumors because of the silence period before the France.   Reuters reports that Intel wants to enter the fiery PC game market by drawing chips.People familiar with the matter revealed that DG2 is expected to be published in the second half of this year or early 2022. Competition with Huida and ultra -micro -semiconductor game graphics cards between $ 400 and $ 600.  People familiar with the matter said that the DG2 manufacturing technology is expected to be more advanced than that of Huida's autumn and adopting the Samsung 8nm process, and it is better than the graphics card produced by Ultra -micro -in TSMC in 7nm process.  Foreign Intel's outsourced foundry orders may be eaten by TSMC and Samsung. Lianbo Investment and Citi Securities analyzed yesterday. TSMC's advanced process is faster than Samsung, and the yield is better than Samsung. It is expected to win the Intel List as the biggest winner.Lianbo's latest release of TSMC reports, with ""when the whole world needs you"" as a big title, emphasizes that TSMC technology is pivotal. Intel wants to recover the glory in the processor, it is bound to choose the best TSMC.  Lianbo said that TSMC's advanced process is alone in the world, and the world needs the help of TSMC. Therefore, Intel may entrust important chips to TSMC in terms of technical selection, including 3nm mass production in 2023, and competitors super micro -micro -micro -micro The high chance of follow -up makes 3 nanometers the most powerful process of TSMC.Lianbo said that if Intel preliminarily released 20%of orders to TSMC, TSMC's revenue expected in 2023 increased an additional 7%to 8%, so that the revenue of the year can still reach 13 in recent years. %Of the strong increase, 35 yuan per share; the revenue expected from 2022 to 2023 can increase by 21%.  Lianbo believes that with Intel OEMs, TSMC's future revenue, profit, and shareholders' equity rates will be paid unrequnted performance, and market evaluation will continue to be repaired. It is expected that the capital expenditure from TSMC 2021 to 2023 is expected to increase the capital expenditure from 2021 to 2023, with an increase of US $ 21 billion, 23 billion and US $ 23 billion, respectively.Citi issued the Intel Report prediction to predict the plan announced on the 21st, stating that in order to compete with opponents such as Chaowei, most of the first wave of chip materials were entrusted to TSMC.  Citi believes that Intel's first wave may entrust TSMC for drawing chips and some low -end ATOM processors. It is estimated that Intel will release an additional $ 2 billion order for each release, TSMC's revenue will increase by additional 5.$ 600 million. Among them, Citi estimates that the Intel Atom processor contributes about $ 9 billion in revenue, representing TSMC's revenue in this part that may increase by 2.5 billion US dollars.  *** Bernstein's latest report pointed out that although TSMC's stock price has risen, it is certain that under the premise of science and technology, advanced semiconductor wafer foundry processes are required worldwide. Related services, Intel is likely to turn to TSMC 3nm in 2023. Ultra -micro (AMD) is also expected to follow up, bringing a larger upper range to TSMC.Xu Zhenzhi, director of the research department of the Taiwan District of Citi Global Securities, predicts that the shipments of Apple and other 5G and 4G smart machines have improved. For orders, TSMC will increase by 17 % annually with USD pricing revenue in 2021.In addition to the long -term business opportunities of the Intel Outreaders, the research institution is optimistic about Isaiah Research. The production capacity utilization rate of various processes of TSMC is almost full. Single decline, but in the first half of the year, there may be a mining -related injection from Bitcoin, and the capacity utilization rate will reach 90-95 %. As for the volume of chips such as Apple A15 application processor orders and MediaTek Tianye 2000 in the second half of the year, the capacity utilization rate is expected to be full.As for the market that the market is concerned about the competitive pressure of TSMC in South Korea, Bernstein believes that it is too much. The main reason is that Samsung's technology has begun to accumulate electricity, and the future gap is at least three years.  Assuming that the expectations of the Intel CPU outsourcing without or delay occur, will it have a negative impact on TSMC? In this regard, Bernstein gives a negative answer and judged that if Intel's out -of -commitment of OEM decides that the upstream is unpredictable, AMD will seize the opportunity to seize more points. No matter from that perspective, TSMC is a big winner. [Industry and Commerce]","I said this at the end of last year   But it's a pity that I haven't guess the level of funds crazy. Today, the highest is 632 The 400 ""Reasonable Price"" you just wait. If there is no systemic risk this year, you can't see this price. As for TSMC's future stock price?

142,290,台積電2020年獲利創下歷史新高達19.97元，以法說會提供的年度展望，2021年營收仍將成長15%，續創歷史新高，合理估算2021年獲利可以成長到23元左右，碰巧，前高679元價位，也是台積電的歷史最高本益比30倍附近，再以去年配發10元股息估算，股息殖利率僅剩下1.47%，讓保守的資金不再追價，外資逢高獲利，紅盤以來，外資累計賣超14萬張，大幅賣壓讓台積電一度跌破600元整數關卡。  不過，台積電全球地位領先，趨勢成長，此次股價下跌，也剛好讓偏高的評價適度修正，今年的台積電，隨著獲利成長，股息也可能會上看13元，修正過後的股價，評價也更合理，屆時法人買盤進場買進，投資朋友也以把握股息、價差雙頭賺的好買點。  以股利13元殖利率5%為基準，台積電合理估值為260元，資金行情，狂印紙幣的泛濫洪流下，噴到800，上看1000，只看金流，但一旦資金退朝，巴菲特「退潮看誰在裸泳」理論成為實際，一個有年成長力道15%，又居產業領導地位的公司，我們願意將殖利率降到2.5%為基準，台積電合理估值則為520元,二月二十五日倫敦銅見到每噸9617美元，二月份漲了21.97%，距離萬元整數關卡剩下三百美元，美原油來到每桶63.79美元，同樣單月也漲了21.63%，第一季的春季躁動行情，大宗商品是贏家。  經濟復甦投資主線活躍  在疫苗大量施打，美國COVID-19確診人數連續六周下滑，英國也宣布四階段解封，希望在六月二十一日之前恢復正常生活，經濟復甦的投資主線仍活躍在盤面，例如去年全球倒閉超過八十家的航空業，今年農曆春節過後轉變為股市的強勢股，華航與長榮航上周分別上漲+14.72%、+18%，更令人驚奇的是，觀光類股的易飛網拉出五連板，再對照雄獅上漲19%，才發現原來市場已經領先反映疫情最壞的情況已經過去，儘管邊境隔離管制十四天還不能解禁，但股民已經迫不及待提前預期反映，王品、美食-KY、好樂迪等同步上漲。  就在大宗商品大漲之後，在COVID-19疫情後，全球央行大放水，通膨的議題成為這次聯準會主席的國會聽證的焦點。由於疫苗問世，市場對於經濟復甦的預期漸強，避險需求降低，以至於拋售美國公債導致殖利率上升。  而殖利率上升的現象，又被另一部分市場人士解讀為聯準會在不久的未來可能升息，因而造成股市的賣壓湧出，特別是農曆春節前擁擠的科技股更是賣壓的震央區，無巧不巧的美國證監會要調查特斯拉與狗狗幣的關係，進一步拖累科技股的人氣，FAANG、AMD、NVDA、QCOM、INTC、MSFT等主要科技股全數走弱，多少也有擔憂拜登反對科技股巨頭的壟斷。  台積電美國設廠成本超標  於是資金轉戰傳產股，使得新春開紅盤後的台積電、聯發科、日月光等半導體股逆勢下跌，當然一部分原因跟缺水有關，南部水庫已經剩下三十至六十天的存水量，沒想到把新冠病毒成功隔絕的台灣，竟然也順帶連颱風一併隔絕在外，接下來要等到五、六月的梅雨季才能解決旱象，估計今年又得省水大作戰。  不過缺水還不算急迫，反倒是美、日、德車商動用政治力量來關說台灣的晶圓代工廠解決車用晶片缺貨的問題，不知道影響毛利率多少？  而且拜登還簽署行政命令將解決缺芯問題，就長期的角度，美商自建先進晶圓廠自然是緩不濟急，所以短期拉攏台廠建立戰略聯盟是必然的選擇，可是根據日媒報導，台積電計畫在美國設立的五奈米廠的成本將超出預算數倍，美國廠會成為台積電的包袱嗎？當年台塑在美設廠也是經過多年之後才扭轉虧損。  自從英特爾新技術型執行長在一月中旬宣布七奈米製程取得重大進展，外資一路賣超台積電至今，台積電股價從679元跌到606元，-10.75%跌幅，三月十七日除息2.5元，看來前波的591元低點在除息前可能要接受挑戰。  關於通膨，美國與中國所面臨的情況大不同。上周聯準會主席鮑爾在連續兩日的眾議院金融服務委員會聽證會上表示，美國經濟復甦遠未實現，未來仍存在較高的不確定性。他承諾聯準會將維持接近零利率旨在實現通膨在一段時間裡溫和超過2%的目標，還表態將維持現有公債和抵押支援債券購買速度，直到後續進展實質性達到聯準會的政策目標。  美國通膨預期大幅抬升  從聯準會放大對通膨的容忍度，對於其他國家來說，變相的有輸入性通膨的壓力，尤其是中國。  理由：(1)這一輪美國通膨的回升速度和力度可能要比以往都要大。除了疫情初期，聯準會就推出全部寬鬆措施，美國民眾資產負債表不僅沒有受損，反而大幅改善，雖然失業明顯增加，但直接給民眾大量「發錢」的寬鬆模式，百姓收入反而更高了。  (2)撇開因為疫情受害的交通服務(如航空、汽車)消費減少而壓抑了原油需求，其實美國居民的商品類消費已經遠遠高於疫情之前的水準，因為民眾在家防疫，為了打發時間與活動身體，修繕類的需求大增，導致美國耐久財消費通膨已經創下了二十五年來的最高位，整體商品消費通膨水準已經創下二○一三年以來的最高位。  跟二○○八年金融海嘯相比，當時美國是供給和需求都緩慢修復，但這一輪經濟衰退，只要疫情防控減小，民眾就可以出門「花錢」，需求可以快速恢復到接近正常。  所以儘管去年十二月美國整體通膨水準(PCE)只有1.3%，核心通膨也只有1.5%，可是美國通膨預期已經在大幅抬升，近期美國TIPS反映的通膨預期最高突破了2.2%，創下了二○一四年以來最高紀錄，美國十年期公債名義利率也突破了1.3%。  現在市場擔心如果美國實際的通膨不斷走高，突破2~3%，而美國失業人口改善的速度不如預期，聯準會太慢縮減QE規模或升息等操作，重演類似一九七○年代末期的惡性通貨膨脹。又或者緊縮貨幣政策的速度比二○○八年金融危機後來得快，傷害到股市，於是農曆春節後那斯達克指數跌了13.42%，引發上周亞股也同步大跌，恆生跌5.43%、上証跌5.06%、台灣加權跌2.37%。  美國商品貿易逆差歷史新高  港股與陸股的跌幅較重，就是因為中國疫情控制得比歐美來得快，生產端修復得快，美國從中國進口額的占比很快回升到了貿易摩擦之前的水準。美國在全球終端需求中的占比將近四分之一，短期內進口大量增加，美國的商品貿易逆差突破了二○○八年以來的最高點，再度創出歷史新高。  與此同時，美國服務貿易順差降到了十年來的最低位，美國整體的貿易逆差是明顯擴大的，其實就是在向全球輸出美元、輸出通膨。因為中國出口增速不斷攀升，GDP已修復到正常水準，所以過年前人民銀行已經祭出緊縮貨幣的手段，預期今年兩會之後，中國的貨幣政策將穩定宏觀槓桿率，意味著社融增速要趨於回落，信用政策會收緊。所以機構法人開始針對過度擁擠的白酒、醫療、科技等抱團藍籌股減碼，預期第一季財報公布結束之前，全球股市將處在中期整理的階段。  晶圓產能大缺  近期追蹤的軋空股─天鈺二○二○年前三季EPS 1.38元，第四季大幅成長，全年EPS達4.07元，主要是受惠於集團內的夏普晶圓代工產能的支援，得以在當前晶圓產能大缺的情況下，維持業績成長，二○二一年一月自結EPS 1.3元，粗估全年EPS可望翻倍。  五月十八日召開股東會，三月十二日為融券最後回補日，截至二月二十五日為止，融券餘額為4273張，而且目前處在分盤交易，須等到三月九日才恢復正常交易，具備融券強制回補的力道。  https://money.udn.com/money/story/5607/5297577,0.042483660130718005,0.037459283387622,0.0,0.0,1,0,"TSMC's profit in 2020 reached a record of 19.97 yuan. The annual outlook provided by the Fa said that the revenue in 2021 will still grow 15%, renewing a record high. Reasonable estimation of the profit in 2021 can grow to about 23 yuan. It happens that it happens that it will happen. The price of 679 yuan in the previous high, which is also the highest rate of interest to TSMC nearly 30 times the maximum interest ratio, and then issued a dividend rate of 10 yuan last year. The dividend yield is only 1.47%, let conservative funds no longer chase the price, foreign investment has made high profits. Since the red market, foreign capital has sold over 140,000 pieces, and the significant selling pressure has caused TSMC to fall below the 600 yuan integer level.  However, TSMC has a global leader in the world and the trend has grown. The decline in the stock price has just made the high evaluation moderate amendment. This year's TSMC, with the growth of profit, the dividend may also look at 13 yuan. It is also more reasonable. At that time, the legal person bought the market to buy, and the investment friends would also buy a good buying point to grasp the dividend and price difference.Based on a dividend 13 yuan yield 5%as the benchmark, TSMC's reasonable valuation is 260 yuan, the capital market, the flood of the banknotes of the banknotes, sprayed to 800, look at 1,000, only look at the money, but once the funds retreat, Buffett Buffett once the capital retreats, but Buffett's Buffett retreats, Buffett, Buffett, The theory of ""seeing the naked swimming"" has become a reality. A company with an annual growth force and a leading position in the industry.","On February 25th, London Copper saw $ 9,617 per ton, and rose 21.97%in February. It was $ 300 from the 10,000 yuan integer level. US crude oil came to $ 63.79 per barrel.63%, in the first season of spring restlessness, commodities are winners.  Economic recovery investment main line is active  In a large number of vaccines, the number of people in the United States COVID-19 has declined for six consecutive weeks. The United Kingdom also announced the unseainence of the four stages. I hope to resume normal life before June 21. The world's closure of more than 80 aviation industry. After the Chinese New Year this year, it turned into a strong stock in the stock market. China Airlines and Evergreen Airlines rose +14 last week.72%,+18%, even more surprising that the Yifei.com of the tourist stocks pulled out the five -line board and then rose 19%against the lion. Although the border isolation control cannot be lifted for fourteen days, shareholders can not wait to reflect in advance, Wang Pin, Gourmet-KY, and Holydi have risen simultaneously.  Just after the commodity rose, after the COVID-19 epidemic, the global central bank draft water, and the issue of inflation became the focus of the chairman of the Federal Mascoon.As the vaccine came out, the market's expectations for economic recovery gradually became stronger, and the demand for risk aversion decreased, so that the selling of US public bonds led to an increase in yields.  The phenomenon of rising yields was interpreted by another part of the market as the Federal Subsidies that may raise interest rates in the near future, which caused the stock market to sell pressure. In particular, the crowded technology stocks before the Lunar New Year are the earthquakes. , Coincidentally, the US Securities Regulatory Commission wants to investigate the relationship between Tesla and dog coins, and further drags the popularity of technology stocks. FAANG, AMD, NVDA, QCOM, INTC, MSFT and other major technology stocks have weakened. Biden opposes the monopoly of technology stock giants.TSMC's US factory cost exceeds the standard  So the funds transferred to the production stocks, which caused the semiconductor stocks such as TSMC, MediaTek, and Sun Moonlight after the New Year's popularity. Of course, some reasons were related to the lack of water. Taiwan, where the new crown virus is separated from the other, is separated by typhoons. The next May or June plum -in rainy season will not be resolved to solve the drought. It is estimated that this year will have to save water.However, the lack of water is not urgent. Instead, the US, Japanese, and German car dealers use political forces to closely say that Taiwan's wafer founding factory solves the problem of lack of vehicle chips. I do n’t know how much it affects the gross profit margin?  In addition, Biden also signed an administrative order to solve the problem of core lack. From a long -term perspective, it is natural to build an advanced wafer fabal factory for American businessmen, so it is an inevitable choice to draw a strategic alliance in the short term. TSMC plans to set up the five -nanic factory in the United States will exceed several times more budget. Will the US factory become the burden of TSMC? Formosa Plastics also reversed their losses after years.Since the CEO of Intel's new technology model announced in mid-January that the seven-nanometer process has made significant progress, since the foreign investment has sold super-building electricity, TSMC's stock price has fallen from 679 yuan to 606 yuan, -10.75%has fallen.5 yuan, it seems that the low point of the 591 yuan of the front wave may accept the challenge before removing.  Regarding inflation, the situation facing the United States and China is very different. Last week, the Fed Chairman Ball said at a hearing of the House of Representatives of the House of Representatives for two consecutive days that the US economic recovery was far from being realized, and there was still high uncertainty in the future. He promised that the Fed will maintain a near -zero interest rate to achieve the goal of gently more than 2%for a period of time in inflation, and also stated that it will maintain the purchase speed of existing bonds and mortgage support bonds until the subsequent progress has reached the policy of the Federal Strategy Association's policy. Target.US inflation expectations rise sharply  The tolerance of inflation from the Federal Assembly will be enlarged. For other countries, the pressure of input inflation in disguise, especially China.  Reasons: (1) This round of inflation rate and intensity may be larger than before. In addition to the early stage of the epidemic, the Feds' Association launched all loose measures. The U.S. people's balance sheet not only did not damage, but instead improved significantly. Although the unemployment increased significantly, it directly gave the people a large number of ""money"" loose models. It's right.(2) Leaving aside the reduction of crude oil demand due to the reduction of traffic services (such as aviation and automobiles). In fact, the commodity consumption of American residents is much higher than the level before the epidemic. The increase in the demand for repairing categories has greatly increased, leading to the highest position in the United States for durable wealth consumption in the past 25 years, and the overall commodity consumption inflation level has reached the highest position since 2013.Compared with the financial tsunami in 2008, the United States was slowly repaired at that time, but this round of economic recession, as long as the epidemic prevention and control decrease, the public can go out to ""spend money"", and the demand can be quickly returned to normal Essence  Therefore, although the overall inflation level (PCE) in the United States in December last year was only 1.3%, and the core inflation was only 1.5%. However, the U.S. inflation expectations have been rising sharply. The inflation expectations reflected in the US TIPS recently exceeded 2.2%. The highest record since 2014, the nominal interest rate of the 10 -year public debt in the United States has also exceeded 1.3%.  Now the market is worried that if the actual inflation of the United States has continued to rise, breaking through 2 to 3%, and the rate of improvement of the unemployment population in the United States is not as expected, the Federal Mandrilion will reduce the operation of QE or increase interest rates, and repeat the similar to the late 1970s in the late 1970s. Vicious inflation. Or the speed of tightening the monetary policy is faster than the financial crisis in 2008, which hurts the stock market. Therefore, the Nasdaq index fell 13.42%after the Lunar New Year, which caused the Asian stocks to fall simultaneously last week. 5.43%, Shanghai Stock Exchange Falling 5.06%, Taiwan's weighted drop 2.37%.  History of American commodity trade deficit history  The decline in Hong Kong stocks and land stocks is that the Chinese epidemic is controlled faster than Europe and the United States, and the production side has faster the production side. The proportion of imports from China's imports quickly rose to the level before trade friction. The United States accounts for nearly a quarter of the global terminal demand, and the imports have increased in the short term. The US commodity trade deficit has exceeded the highest point since 2008, and once again reached a record high.At the same time, the US service trade surplus has fallen to the lowest position in the past ten years. The overall trade deficit of the United States has expanded significantly. In fact, it is exporting US dollars and inflation to the world. Because China's export growth rate has continued to rise, GDP has been repaired to normal level, so the People's Bank of China had sacrificed the austerity of currency before the New Year. It is expected that after the two sessions this year, China's monetary policy will stabilize the macro leverage, which means that social merging growth rate will be necessary Tighten the decline and the credit policy will be tightened.Therefore, institutional legal persons have begun to reduce codes for over crowded liquor, medical care, and technology. It is expected that before the end of the first quarter of the financial report, the global stock market will be in the stage of midterm.  Wallopedic capacity lack  The recently tracked rolling stocks — Tianyu In the first three quarters of 2020 EPS, 1.38 yuan, the fourth quarter has grown sharply. EPS throughout the year is 4.07 yuan, mainly benefiting from the support of Sharp wafers in the group. With the current lack of wafer capacity, it maintains performance growth. In January 2002, he settled EPS 1.3 yuan, rough estimation of the year EPS is expected to double.  The shareholders' meeting was held on May 18th. On March 12th, the last day of the securities lending was repaid. As of February 25, the balance of securities lending was 4,273. The nineteenth day was resumed in normal transactions, and the power of mandatory recovery of securities lending.  https://money.udn.com/money/story/5607/5297577"

145,296,美國晶片大廠英特爾（Intel Corp）宣布，將投注200億美元（約5700億元台幣）興建兩座先進晶片製造廠，重新將晶片供應角色帶回美國。路透報導指出，此舉直接挑戰目前全球兩大先進晶片製造廠、台積電和南韓三星電子的地位。  英特爾執行長格爾辛格（Pat Gelsinger）周二（3/23）表示，英特爾已經完全解決最近的生產技術問題，強調所有生產晶片的系統都已準備好。英特爾將投注200億美元，在原有的亞利桑那園區興建兩座新的晶片工廠，預計將可增加3千個工作職位。格爾辛格還說，英特爾另計畫在美國其他地區及歐洲設廠。  格爾辛格補充表示，新擴增的兩座工廠除了用來生產英特爾自家晶片外，還開放給其他晶圓代工業者使用。他說，新的工廠將專注於生產最新的先進電腦晶片。  路透報導指出，英特爾擴廠的決定，將讓晶片生產重回到美國和歐洲，主要是因為美歐擔憂目前晶片供應太過集中在台積電，而兩岸的緊張關係很可能影響供應。（國際中心／綜合外電報導）  ----------------------------------------------------  INTC回來了 GG盤後大跌3% 要歐印的人機會又來了 還是又只會嘴砲呢?,"會在南科設廠我看一定是土地成本考量,電可以自己蓋太陽能廠 但是一定沒想到台灣海島會有缺水問題 目前全球因為氣溫升高常出現極端氣候 中南部已經變成熱帶地區,上空常常會有高壓氣團所以很難下雨 以後梅雨季節說不定還只會下在北部最多中部地區 南部一樣沒雨,然後只能靠夏季的西南季風和颱風才會有雨 結果南部之前一直抗議所以沒有新的水庫但是耗水的工廠確一直蓋 竹科缺水還能靠水車到翡翠運水,南科我看你要如何運",0.015100671140939001,0.042483660130718005,-0.033557046979865,0.0,0,1,"Intel Corp, a large US chip factory, announced that it will bet on two advanced chip manufacturers to bet on $ 20 billion (about 570 billion yuan) and re -bring the chip supply role back to the United States. Reuters reported that the move directly challenged the status of the current two advanced chip manufacturers in the world, TSMC and South Korea's Samsung Electronics.  Intel CEO Pat Gelsinger said on Tuesday (3/23) that Intel has completely solved the recent production technical problems and emphasized that all the systems of production chips are ready. Intel will bet $ 20 billion and build two new chip factories in the original Arizona Park, and it is expected to increase 3,000 jobs.Gelinen also said that Intel plans to set up factories in other parts of the United States and Europe.  Gelinen added that in addition to the production of Intel chips, the two newly expanded factories were also opened to other wafer engineers. He said that the new factory will focus on the production of the latest advanced computer chips.  Reuters reports that the decision of Intel's expansion will allow chip production to return to the United States and Europe, mainly because the United States and Europe are concerned that the current chip supply is too concentrated in TSMC, and the tension between the two sides of the strait is likely to affect the supply.(International Center / Comprehensive Foreign Electric Report)  ------------------------------------------------ ----  INTC is back GG fell 3% after the plate The opportunity to be in European seal is here again Or can you only have a canal?","I will set up a factory in Nanke.

Then Biden will support a chip factory, which may be in the United States or on the mainland (Democratic Party, especially Biden, especially in the mainland) This is in line with the current interests of the United States and Democratic Party, and the current US policy direction has changed. Trump draws Russia, India and Taiwan to fight the mainland, so he supports Taiwan GG Now Biden wants to significantly reduce military expenses. Like the United States during World War II, the Asian parts and the mainland cooperate to fight against Russia. In addition, it supports Japan to fight against China and South Korea. Part of Europe used Germany to fight against Russia,Use Britain to Carter  Have you ever heard the story of monkeys and businessmen? A businessman came to a small island.

Later, the monkey was not received at 1,000 yuan. As a result, the businessman said that he had returned to the United States in advance. As a result, his assistant came out and told the people on the island. I used 600 yuan to secretly sell the businessman monkey to you, and when the businessman came back, you were selling it to him with 1,000 yuan As a result, after the assistant sells the monkey,The merchant never returned to this island.

Biden has a big career in the mainland. It is not difficult to make a chip factory a 10 trillion dollars in the mainland to make a chip factory.  When Trump was in his reign, he used anti -Torais to sue the US technology leading stocks, because these companies opposed the US sanctions on the mainland and It is forbidden to buy US high -tech products in Huawei Xiaomi in the mainland.So don't think that the United States is not sanctioned by foreign companies.

152,310,5張456(截至2021/3/16)   總結這一年心得,未雨綢繆是投資的不敗法門－－現階段基泰建設值得考慮   2018年3月美陸貿易爭端初起，市場以美國總統川普商場談判策略解讀，認為最終將圓滿解決，行情隨談判進展波動，台股瘋狂被動元件千年一遇大行情，國巨老闆前妻趁機賣出持股。  當時市場下跌完全符合巴爺爺「恐懼時買進」，筆者服膺「價值股底部成長投資」面對天賜良機，未雨綢繆，買進貿易爭端影響小甚至受益的股票，如台航與信大，一年後看來當初的決定是對的。  2019 年4月底全球股市正沉浸於美陸貿易協定即將簽約的喜悅，台股當然也不例外，加權指數一萬一千點、龍頭台積電270元、股王大立光4900元，昂首邁向新目標，就在一切美好，美國總統川普突然指控陸方反悔之前協議，將提高關稅，討回公道。  這一則訊息引發全球股市動盪，台股不能倖免，尤其是科技類股，20190523台積電、大立光跌到230、3800元，美對陸加徵關稅打亂了科技業供應鏈多年來既有的秩序，市場極端憂慮。  高科技描繪的人類偉大光明前景於我絕緣，因為不做不懂的事，包括投資，我謹記巴爺爺教誨「不投資不懂的行業」，不曾趕上任何高科技的高速列車，享受暴富的快意。  許多分析師攤開一張張的上升圖表，真是人間最美麗的畫作，所刺激的腦內啡源源不絕，可比凡爾賽宮懸掛的拿破崙騎白馬手指阿爾卑斯山山頂的榮耀畫作還多，凡爾賽宮沒有拿破崙兵敗的作品，不代表拿破崙最後的命運，高科技股價漲升的刺激過後往往是墬落不知何時回升的痛苦。  2018年國巨股價1300時奮勇買進的國內外法人，他們辛勤出席公司法說會，窮盡腦汁思索老闆對前妻釋股的誠懇說明、產業前景，挑燈夜戰振筆疾書買進報告，後來股價卻一蹶不振，印證法人當時高檔買進所根據的專業判斷，表面上是搔背癢處的玉如意，其實只是老闆前妻名牌女鞋的鞋跟，被踩在腳下，經不起一點理性的驗證，不知未雨綢繆之痛也。  財富來自於穩當的深入了解，心裡比較踏實，參透這點之後，對不懂產業股價的暴起要完全無動於衷，才能杜絕暴落的煎熬，「價值股底部成長投資」找到投資標的後，底部儘可能大量買進擴大戰果，並不時檢視產業及公司近況，因為都是簡單易懂的行業，不必燒掉腦子，就能判斷。  美陸貿易戰至今長期對抗，科技業多年建立供應鏈調整的不確定性成為股市最大的挑戰，2019年5月27日營建類股普遍上揚，保守資金轉向明顯，只是營建類股那麼多，要挑那個。  資金如潮水，若房市邁出谷底，營建股上漲將持續，反之，將如程咬金的三斧頭，劈完就沒下文，現在房市景氣不明，個股有規模、地域、股價、前景等考量，貿然介入，風險其實不低。  宏盛2018年6月開始營收就沒有前五月的威猛，今年到四月止營收也較去年同期大幅減少，不知何時才能恢復，股價由2018年8月初高檔42元下跌，自宣布今年不發股利，改為減資後，更大跌至19.9元。  宏璟2019營收自一月份開始就消風，沒有2018年下半年的旺盛買氣，股價也大幅修正。  據說新北市降低囤房稅率，新北市建商減緩推案速度待價而沽，是否為真，也是不能明說的秘密，估妄聽之，但同樣的建案買氣突然消風真是營建業投資的最大風險。  個別公司也許區域建案大賣而有一陣漲勢，但賣完之後也要面對整體房市的走勢，代銷龍頭海悅今年以來業績也沒有去年火熱，代表營建業整體其實買氣不強，何時能恢復景氣誰也說不準。  房市走勢最後還是與整體經濟景氣、政府政策、稅制有關，明年大選政府政策與稅制不可能大幅改變，如今最有可能變化的就是整體經濟景氣，必需未雨綢繆。  台灣面臨美陸貿易戰爭，整體經濟景氣不可能正面好轉，政府大張其鼓，數千億資金回流，將注入活水，媒體也幫腔，台商有買房購地的需求，但這重心在土地廠房，至於房屋，美麗的鬱金香終於有人播下種子，在美陸貿易戰爭吹襲下，是否能順利長成大片的花園，散放幽幽香氣，這美景夢境值得尊敬。  目前有些營建股走勢凌厲，各有題材，但潮水般的資金退潮，屆時房市未如政府敲鑼打鼓吹捧的經濟景氣一起上揚，股價如宏盛腰斬，也是血跡斑斑的歷史值得警惕。  現階段不要羨慕漲多的某些營建股，反而要多注意底部起漲，又能避開房市受經濟不振影響較小的個股，基泰建設即是保守資金不錯的標的。  基泰2019年5月27日上漲0.45元，收12.15元，市場矚目的建案「基泰忠孝」，基地478坪，37樓約12000坪（找不到資料的估算），規劃為商場、酒店、辦公室，將出租，不出售，這37層的大樓興建多年即將完工，美國紐約帝國大廈1930年動工，1931年落成，90年前103層的大樓僅410天就完工，可見台灣的建築業多麼落後到不知長進。  我2018年5月11.10買進基泰，9月13.1元賣出後，股價漲到15元，市場可能因公司不打算全棟出售而失望回跌，我於2019年3、4月間11.8、11.65元補回，股價於2019年5月盤低至11.55元。  基泰這幾年只蓋「基泰忠孝」，業績平平，近三年股利平衡政策卻能發出1、0.8、0.6的股利，算算殖利率，也是對長期投資人苦守寒窯的體恤。  「基泰忠孝」地點位於台北火車站，地點絕佳，單出租收益即非常可觀，保守估計，12000坪每月每坪租金平均3000元，一個月租金收入達三千六百萬，一年為四億三千萬，這營收及獲利成長非常驚人，如果公司決定整棟出售，更是天大的利多。  基泰股價長期低檔，好不容易煉成一劍，未來豈是這般價錢，就耐心等待完工利多的刺激，收成股價的上漲。,0.010050251256281001,0.008163265306122,-0.045226130653266,-0.020408163265306003,1,1,5 pieces 456 (as of 2021/3/16)   Summarize this year's experience,"Waterg brush -up is the undefeated method of investment -at this stage of Kitai Construction is worth considering   From the beginning of March 2018, the US -Lu trade dispute was interpreted with the negotiation strategy of US President Trump Mall, and it was believed that it would be successfully resolved. The market fluctuated with the negotiations. Stocks.  At that time, the market decline was fully in line with Grandpa Paba's ""buying when fear"". The author was convinced that ""the growth investment at the bottom of the value stock"" faced the opportunity of heavenly gifts, planning ahead, and buying trade disputes. Later, it seemed that the original decision was right.At the end of April 2019, the global stock market is immersed in the joy of the US -Land Trade Agreement. Of course, Taiwan stocks are no exception. The weighted index is 11,000 points, the leader of the leader of the leader, and 4,900 yuan in the stock king. Just all the beauty, US President Trump suddenly accused Lu Fang regret the previous agreement, which will raise tariffs and recover justice.  This message caused the global stock market to be turbulent, and Taiwan stocks could not be spared, especially technology stocks. In 20190523 TSMC, Dali Guang fell to 230 and 3800 yuan. The market is extremely concerned.High -tech portrayal of the great light prospects of human beings are insulating, because I do n’t understand things, including investment, I remember that Grandpa Paba teachs “an industry that does n’t invest and does n’t understand.” Full pleasure.Many analysts spread out the rising charts, which are really the most beautiful paintings on the world. The stimulating brain brown sources are endless. Napoleon's defeat does not mean Napoleon's last fate. The stimulus of high -tech stock prices is often the pain that he does not know when it will rise.In 2018, the domestic and foreign legal persons who were bravely bought by the national huge stock price were 1300. They diligently attended the company's law, exhausted their brains and thought about the boss's sincere explanation of the ex -wife's release of stocks and the industrial prospects. , Prove the professional judgment based on the high -end buying at that time. On the surface, it was jade Ruyi, which was itchy. In fact, it was just the heel of the boss's ex -wife brand -name women's shoes. The pain also.Wealth comes from a deep understanding of a steady and deeper understanding, and it is relatively practical in my heart. After penetrating this point, it is completely indifferent to the violence that does not understand the industrial stock price in order to prevent the suffering of violence. A large number of buying and expanding the results of the war, from time to time, check the industry and the company's recent situation, because they are all easy -to -understand industries. You can judge that you don't have to burn your brains.The U.S. -Land Trade War has been confronted for a long time. The uncertainty of the technology industry has established supply chain adjustments for many years. Pick that.  The funds are like tide. If the housing market takes the bottom of the valley, the rise in construction shares will continue. Involved, the risks are not low.Hongsheng's revenue began in June 2018 without the prestige of the previous May. The revenue from this year to April also decreased significantly compared with the same period last year. After this year, it does not issue dividends, and after reducing capital reduction, it has fallen to 19.9 yuan.  Hongye's 2019 revenue has become popular since January. Without the strong buying in the second half of 2018, the stock price has also been greatly amended.  It is said that New Taipei City has reduced the taxation rate of house hoarding, and whether the construction of the builders in New Taipei City slowed down the price to be sold at the price. Whether it is true is also the secret that it cannot be explicit. The biggest risk.  Individual companies may have a big sales and have a rise in regional construction, but after they are sold, they must also face the overall housing market trend. The sales leader Haiyue has not been hot last year this year. No one can recover the prosperity.In the end, the housing market trend is related to the overall economic prosperity, government policies, and taxation systems. Next year, the government policy and tax system of the election cannot change significantly. Now the most likely to change is the overall economic prosperity, which must be planned.Facing the US -land trade war, the overall economic prosperity cannot improve positively. As for the house, the beautiful tulips finally sowed the seeds. Under the blow of the U.S. -Land Trade War, whether it could grow smoothly into a large garden and dispersed the faint aroma. This beautiful scenery is worthy of respect.At present, some construction stocks have a sharp trend and their own themes, but the tide -like funds are ebb. At that time, the housing market will not rise together as the government's tumping economic downturn. The stock price is like Hongsheng.  At this stage, do not envy some of the construction stocks. Instead, pay more attention to the rise at the bottom, but also avoid the stock market that is less affected by the economic dumping of the housing market. Kitai Construction is the target of good conservative funds.  Kitai rose 0.45 yuan on May 27, 2019, closed 12.15 yuan, the market -based construction case ""Kitai Zhongxiao"", 478 pings in the base, about 12,000 pings on the 37th floor (the estimate of the information can not be found). The construction of the building has been completed for many years. The Empire Building of the United States started in 1930 and completed in 1931. The building on the 103 -story building was completed in only 410 days before. It can be seen how much Taiwan ’s construction industry is behind.  I bought Kitai at 11.10 in May 2018. After selling in September 13.1 yuan, the stock price rose to 15 yuan. The market may be disappointed and fell because the company did not intend to sell the whole building. The stock price was low as low as 11 in May 2019.55 yuan.  In recent years, Kitai has only covered ""Kitai Zhongxiao"" and has a mediocre performance. However, the dividend balance policy in the past three years can issue 1, 0.8, 0.The dividend of 6, calculating the yield rate, is also a compassion for long -term investors to keep the cold kiln.  The location of ""Kitai Zhongxiao"" is located at the Taipei Railway Station. The location is excellent. The lease income is very considerable. The conservative estimate is that the average rent per ping of 12,000 pings per ping is 3,000 yuan per ping. 430 million, this revenue and profit growth are very amazing. If the company decides to sell the whole building, it is even more profitable.  Kitai's stock price has been low -end for a long time, and it is difficult to make a sword. How will the future be so price, just wait patiently to wait for the stimulus of the comprehensive Lidu, and harvest the stock price rising."

But it is too decent to afford a pool of Chunshui.After these waves of frequency innovation high, there should be few people with Acer stocks like dead fish, only stubborn investors, and people who have been numb for many years.   One is happy, and the other is worried! What likes that the Acer of the edge people wants no one. Worried that foreign capital also played Acer as a wooden man and did not fluctuate. If you pull it up, hit it, and you will die. In the future, if you fell thousands of points, I really don't know how much Acer wants to fall. It is only fortunate that the yield is getting higher and higher.Is it to buy? Still selling? Is it the dusty pearl? Or is the stinky stone next to the ditch? I advise the guests to follow the trend and go right ...  This is only released!   It is really hard to say before reducing capital reduction.  You can also change the chairman. Even the capital reduction allows the company to have no judgment in the future.  It will only stare at the cost and stare for the goods, which is just a good financial work.  I heard that it was a sales master, and I haven't sold much in the past few years.   The company got it, and I had to touch it. Then I had to do it. I used to play games. The general general who could not go up with everything was the most abolished.Acer currently feels like this.","Is Acer going off?  Today, a lot of daily limit 128322  Do you have any information?

At the beginning of the year, the five kings of Life Insurance were anxious to see Gu Lixiong, the chairman of the Financial Management Association, to borrow the second bucket of gold in foreign exchange reserves, but by the end of May due to the great depreciation of the NT $, the water level of the life insurance industry's foreign exchange reserve was about 100 billion yuan. In addition, the cost of hedging has dropped sharply, and the ""alert is temporarily lifted"". The opportunity for exchange costs for the whole year is lower than in 2018.The top eight life insurance companies, Cathay Life, Fubon Life, Nanshan Life, Nanshan Life, Xinguang Life, Taiwan Life, China Life, Sanchang Meibang Life and Global Life, and the amount of foreign exchange reserve in April and May is about 32.5 billion yuan, almost almost It is four times the number of deposits in the first quarter.

The life insurance industry said that the exchange cost of the exchange at the beginning of the year will not be seen. If the spread of China and the United States is further reduced, the cost of exchange and avoidance (CS) may decline. If the Taiwan dollar is stable against the US dollar, the opportunity for exchange costs for the whole year is lower than last year.At the beginning of the year, the chairman of Fubon Life Chairman Cai Mingxing and other life insurance companies wanted to meet with Gu Lixiong, that is, the life insurance industry originally estimated that the Federal Federation (FED) will continue to raise interest rates this year, but Taiwan ’s interest rates are not moved, Taiwan and the United States spreads spreads. It will continue to expand. Last year, CS costs have been more than 2 %, which may be higher this year, which will cause great pressure. Therefore, hoping that the Financial Management will agree to borrow a second barrel of gold to give foreign exchange reserve, so that companies will not be dragged by the exchange rate this year. fall.However, Cai Mingxing took the lead in reporting in May, saying that Fubon Life has already had exchange benefits, and a large number of foreign exchange reserves were added. At the end of May, the balance would exceed 14 billion yuan. The balance of foreign exchange reserve reached a new high in history.  Next, if the US interest rate cuts, the exchange cost of the life insurance industry may be further reduced. After the exchange of risk aversion and the loss of the exchange benefits is expected to occur."

20,40,我不想等。今天掛了90.4元買了一台，正式加入中華電信的行列，和你一起進退！！,4G時代的來臨（僅在年底……僅……治愈本次4G中的三大頻段A1~A4（700MHz）；B1~B3（900MHz）；C1~C5（ 1800MHz）A1~A4（700MHz）是新開放的頻段（A1-10M、A2-10M、A3-10M、A4-15M），新手在這裡有發揮的空間，因為這個頻段是非常乾淨和頻繁的頻段，反正ENB是新設，入門門檻也低（總量金額），除了A4超100億，其餘A1~A3都超過60億元，A4是從台灣拿到的，主要是看他是15M的頻寬，不過也會比較吃力，因為ENB必須重修 B1~B3（800MHz）沒有太大的熱情，不過稍加改動B1就被台星拿到了，不過這個頻率帶也是用原用戶亞太107年12月用的。而且台星只標註了這個頻段，不過最近聽說兩個要合作。估計不會合作了以後吃。 B2仍為中國電氣（原中國電氣頻率帶，繼續為中國電氣使用）持有，B3由國機取得。這個頻段在106年7月之前真的是大雜燴。我記得是的，中泰的三個農場都可以使用這個頻段。好在國機也有A3，初期操作沒問題。 C1~C5真是大殺粉。 3GPP定義在BAND 4，也是很多國家都用的頻段（外國人來台誰用？所以是每個行業都必須堅守的戰場。另外，原業（中台元）運作C1~C4 很長一段時間，C5 是新頻段。C2（中）和C3（遠）分別由中國電氣和遠川接續。C1 是台灣獲得的，但這個頻段是由原用戶長期用電到6月106，這個開通後使用穩定就不能用了。還是合作？？C4是元寶電器拿到的，但是這個頻段是台灣大使原用戶用的106年6月，這個只能等開通後使用的穩定性。還是合作？？C5是中國電氣拿到的，而且是地王款，因為頻段沒有人，最大頻寬是15MHz，開啟後的穩定性ng一定有加成效果，讓我們拭目以待。目前，中國電氣是最原創樂隊的一支。 4G是早期預期的。之後就看運營商的視角和策略了。如果你是對的，請幫助指正，不足之處也將幫助增加！,0.005476451259583,0.0043668122270740005,-0.00328587075575,-0.006550218340611,1,0,"I don't want to wait.

Except for A4 exceeding 10 billion, the remaining A1 ~ A3 are more than 6 billion yuan, A4 is obtained from Taiwan. It is mainly to see that he is 15M's frequency width, but it will also be relatively hard, because ENB must be re -built  B1 ~ B3 (800MHz) does not have much passion, but with a small change B1 was obtained by Taiwan Star, but this frequency belt also used the original user Asia Pacific to use in December 107.

C1 ~ C5 is really large killing powder. 3GPP is defined in BAND 4, which is also a frequency band used by many countries (who will use when foreigners come to Taiwan? Therefore, it is a battlefield that each industry must hold. In addition, the original industry (Zhongtai Yuan) operates C1 ~ C4 for a long time, and the C5 is the new frequency band.C2 (middle) and C3 (far) are continued by China Electric and Yuanchuan, respectively. C1 was obtained by Taiwan, but this frequency band was used by the original user's long -term electricity to June 106. This will not be able to use the stability of use after opening. Or cooperation ?? C4 was obtained by Yuan Poor Electric, but this frequency band was used by the original user of Taiwan's Ambassador to June 106. This will only wait for the stability of use after opening. Or cooperation ?? C5 was obtained by China Electric, and it was the ground king section, because there were no people in the frequency band, and the maximum frequency width was 15MHz, The stability after the opening must have a bonus effect, let's wait and see.At present, China Electric is the one with the most original bands. The 4G was expected in the early stage. After that, it depends on the perspective and strategy of the operator.

In fact, this is the overwhelming correction of the global stock market since the fourth quarter of last year.  He said that if the yield of public bonds has risen, TSMC maintains a dividend of 10 yuan last year, and its dividend return and 10 -year public debt yields in the United States have been between Bo Zhong, which will inevitably affect the long -term investment value of TSMC and become a significant under the US debt storm.

Taiwan is a dangerous place, because the United States and China also want it. In case of the situation, the global IC will be stopped. Especially when facing the epidemic and home economy, when the supply of IC cannot continue, it will become a big disaster.

Reuters first disclosed on the 12th that the foundry cooperation plan of Intel and TSMC will be The independent graphics card chip ""DG2"" is first, and the accumulation of 7 nanometers is produced, so that the enemy is fighting against Huida.  Intel is unwilling to comment on relevant reports; TSMC does not respond to market rumors because of the silence period before the France.   Reuters reports that Intel wants to enter the fiery PC game market by drawing chips.People familiar with the matter revealed that DG2 is expected to be published in the second half of this year or early 2022. Competition with Huida and ultra -micro -semiconductor game graphics cards between $ 400 and $ 600.  People familiar with the matter said that the DG2 manufacturing technology is expected to be more advanced than that of Huida's autumn and adopting the Samsung 8nm process, and it is better than the graphics card produced by Ultra -micro -in TSMC in 7nm process.  Foreign Intel's outsourced foundry orders may be eaten by TSMC and Samsung. Lianbo Investment and Citi Securities analyzed yesterday. TSMC's advanced process is faster than Samsung, and the yield is better than Samsung. It is expected to win the Intel List as the biggest winner.Lianbo's latest release of TSMC reports, with ""when the whole world needs you"" as a big title, emphasizes that TSMC technology is pivotal. Intel wants to recover the glory in the processor, it is bound to choose the best TSMC.  Lianbo said that TSMC's advanced process is alone in the world, and the world needs the help of TSMC. Therefore, Intel may entrust important chips to TSMC in terms of technical selection, including 3nm mass production in 2023, and competitors super micro -micro -micro -micro The high chance of follow -up makes 3 nanometers the most powerful process of TSMC.Lianbo said that if Intel preliminarily released 20%of orders to TSMC, TSMC's revenue expected in 2023 increased an additional 7%to 8%, so that the revenue of the year can still reach 13 in recent years. %Of the strong increase, 35 yuan per share; the revenue expected from 2022 to 2023 can increase by 21%.  Lianbo believes that with Intel OEMs, TSMC's future revenue, profit, and shareholders' equity rates will be paid unrequnted performance, and market evaluation will continue to be repaired. It is expected that the capital expenditure from TSMC 2021 to 2023 is expected to increase the capital expenditure from 2021 to 2023, with an increase of US $ 21 billion, 23 billion and US $ 23 billion, respectively.Citi issued the Intel Report prediction to predict the plan announced on the 21st, stating that in order to compete with opponents such as Chaowei, most of the first wave of chip materials were entrusted to TSMC.  Citi believes that Intel's first wave may entrust TSMC for drawing chips and some low -end ATOM processors. It is estimated that Intel will release an additional $ 2 billion order for each release, TSMC's revenue will increase by additional 5.$ 600 million. Among them, Citi estimates that the Intel Atom processor contributes about $ 9 billion in revenue, representing TSMC's revenue in this part that may increase by 2.5 billion US dollars.  *** Bernstein's latest report pointed out that although TSMC's stock price has risen, it is certain that under the premise of science and technology, advanced semiconductor wafer foundry processes are required worldwide. Related services, Intel is likely to turn to TSMC 3nm in 2023. Ultra -micro (AMD) is also expected to follow up, bringing a larger upper range to TSMC.Xu Zhenzhi, director of the research department of the Taiwan District of Citi Global Securities, predicts that the shipments of Apple and other 5G and 4G smart machines have improved. For orders, TSMC will increase by 17 % annually with USD pricing revenue in 2021.In addition to the long -term business opportunities of the Intel Outreaders, the research institution is optimistic about Isaiah Research. The production capacity utilization rate of various processes of TSMC is almost full. Single decline, but in the first half of the year, there may be a mining -related injection from Bitcoin, and the capacity utilization rate will reach 90-95 %. As for the volume of chips such as Apple A15 application processor orders and MediaTek Tianye 2000 in the second half of the year, the capacity utilization rate is expected to be full.As for the market that the market is concerned about the competitive pressure of TSMC in South Korea, Bernstein believes that it is too much. The main reason is that Samsung's technology has begun to accumulate electricity, and the future gap is at least three years.  Assuming that the expectations of the Intel CPU outsourcing without or delay occur, will it have a negative impact on TSMC? In this regard, Bernstein gives a negative answer and judged that if Intel's out -of -commitment of OEM decides that the upstream is unpredictable, AMD will seize the opportunity to seize more points. No matter from that perspective, TSMC is a big winner. [Industry and Commerce]","I said this at the end of last year   But it's a pity that I haven't guess the level of funds crazy. Today, the highest is 632 The 400 ""Reasonable Price"" you just wait. If there is no systemic risk this year, you can't see this price. As for TSMC's future stock price?

142,290,台積電2020年利潤達到創紀錄的19.97元。法提供的年度展望顯示，2021年收入仍將增長15%，再創歷史新高。合理估計2021年的利潤可以增長到23元左右。它發生它會發生它會發生。 679元的價格在前期高位，這也是台積電近30倍最高利率的最高利率，去年又派發了10元的股息率。股息收益率僅為1.47%，讓保守的資金不再追逐價格，外資獲得高額利潤。紅市以來，外資賣出逾14萬片，巨大的拋售壓力導致台積電跌破600元整數水平。但是，台積電在世界範圍內擁有全球領先地位，並且趨勢不斷增長。股價的下跌剛剛讓高評適度修正。今年台積電，隨著利潤的增長，分紅也可能看13元。也比較合理。當時法人買行情買，投資的朋友也會買好買點，把握分紅和差價。以分紅13元收益率5%為基準，台積電的合理估值為260人民幣，資本市場，鈔票的洪流，噴到800，看1000，只看錢，但一旦資金撤退，巴菲特巴菲特一旦資本撤退，但巴菲特的巴菲特撤退，巴菲特，巴菲特，“看到裸泳”的理論已經成為現實。年成長力強，行業領先的公司。,2月25日，倫敦銅報每噸9617美元，2月上漲21.97%。從10000元整數級別上是300美元。美國原油報每桶63.79美元。63%，在春季躁動的第一季，大宗商品是贏家。經濟復甦投資主線活躍 在大量疫苗中，美國COVID-19的人數已連續六週下降。英國也宣布解封四個階段。我希望在6月21日前恢復正常生活。全球80多個航空業關閉。今年春節過後，它變成了股市的強勢股。華航和長榮航空上週分別上漲+14.72%、+18%，更令人意外的是，旅遊股逸飛拉出五線板後逆勢上漲19%。雖然十四天不能解除邊境隔離管控，但股東們已經迫不及待地提前反映，王品、Gourmet-KY、Holydi同步崛起。就在大宗商品大漲之後，在COVID-19疫情之後，全球央行吃水，通脹問題成為聯邦馬斯科恩主席關注的焦點。隨著疫苗的問世，市場對經濟復甦的預期逐漸成為走強，避險需求下降，美國公債拋售帶動收益率上升。收益率上升的現像被另一部分市場解讀為近期可能加息的聯邦補貼，導致股市拋壓。尤其是春節前擁擠的科技股是地震。 ，無獨有偶，美國證監會要調查特斯拉與狗幣的關係，進一步拖累科技股走紅。 FAANG、AMD、NVDA、QCOM、INTC、MSFT等主要科技股均走弱。拜登反對科技股巨頭壟斷，台積電美國工廠成本超標，因此資金轉移到生產股，導致台積電、聯發科、日月光等半導體股跨年走紅。當然，有些原因與缺水有關。新冠病毒與其他隔離的台灣，被颱風隔開。明年5、6月梅雨季將無法解決旱情。估計今年要節水了。不過，缺水並不急。反而美日德車商利用政治力量貼近稱台灣晶圓代工解決車用芯片不足的問題。不知道對毛利率有多大影響？此外，拜登還簽署了解決核心缺失問題的行政令。從長遠來看，為美商打造先進的晶圓晶圓廠是理所當然的，因此在短期內拉攏戰略聯盟是必然選擇。台積電計劃在美國設立五納米工廠將超出預算數倍。美廠會不會成為台積電的包袱？台塑時隔多年也扭虧為盈。自從英特爾新技術模式CEO 1月中旬宣布七納米製程取得重大進展，自外資賣出超建電以來，台積電股價已從679元至606元，下跌-10.75%。5元，看來前浪591元的低點可能會接受挑戰，然後才能解除。關於通脹，美國和中國面臨的情況大不相同。上週，美聯儲主席鮑爾連續兩天在眾議院聽證會上表示，美國經濟復甦遠未實現，未來仍存在較大不確定性。他承諾美聯儲將維持近零利率以實現通脹在一段時間內溫和超過2%的目標，並表示將維持現有債券和抵押支持債券的購買速度，直到隨後的進展已經達到了聯邦戰略協會的政策。目標：美國通脹預期大幅上升 美聯儲對通脹的容忍度將有所擴大。對於其他國家來說，輸入通脹是變相的壓力，尤其是中國。原因：（1）本輪通脹率和強度可能比以往更大。除了疫情初期，美聯儲協會推出了一切寬鬆措施。美國人民的資產負債表不僅沒有受損，反而顯著改善。雖然失業率大幅上升，但直接給老百姓大量的“錢”松模型。是的。（2）暫且不說因交通服務（如航空和汽車）減少而導致的原油需求減少。事實上，美國居民的商品消費遠高於疫情前的水平。維修品類需求增幅大幅提升，導緻美國近25年來耐用財富消費位居最高，整體商品消費通脹水平達到2013年以來最高位。 2008年的海嘯，當時的美國正在慢慢修復，但這一輪經濟衰退，只要疫情防控有所減弱，民眾可以出去“花錢”，需求也能很快恢復正常本質因此，雖然美國去年12月的整體通脹水平（PCE）只有1.3%，核心通脹也只有1.5%。然而，美國的通脹預期一直在急劇上升。美國 TIPS 反映的通脹預期最近超過 2.2%。創2014年以來的最高紀錄，美國10年期公債名義利率也超過1.3%。現在市場擔心，如果美國實際通脹持續上升，突破2%至3%，而美國失業人口的改善速度不及預期，聯邦曼德里昂將下調操作QE或加息，並在1970年代後期重複類似1970年代後期的做法。惡性通貨膨脹。或者說貨幣政策收緊的速度比2008年金融危機還要快，這對股市造成了傷害。因此，納斯達克指數在農曆新年後下跌了13.42%，導致上周亞洲股市同步下跌。 5.43%，上海證券交易所下跌5.06%，台灣加權下跌2.37%。美國大宗商品貿易逆差歷史 港股、地股下跌，是中國疫情控制得比歐美快，生產端有生產端快。從中國進口的進口比例迅速上升到貿易摩擦前的水平。美國占全球終端需求的近四分之一，短期內進口有所增加。美國商品貿易逆差已超過2008年以來的最高點，再次創歷史新高。與此同時，美國服務貿易順差跌至近十年來的最低點。美國整體貿易逆差明顯擴大。事實上，它正在向世界輸出美元和通貨膨脹。由於中國出口增速持續回升，國內生產總值已修復至正常水平，因此中國人民銀行在元旦前犧牲了貨幣緊縮政策。預計今年兩會後我國貨幣政策將穩定宏觀槓桿，這意味著社會合併增速有必要收緊降幅，信貸政策收緊。因此，機構法人開始減持。過度擁擠的酒類、醫療保健和技術的代碼。預計一季度財報結束前，全球股市將處於中期階段。產能不足 近期追踪的機車股——天宇 2020年前三季度EPS為1.38元，四季度大幅增長。全年EPS為4.07元，主要受益於集團內夏普晶圓的支持。在目前晶圓產能不足的情況下，保持業績增長。 2002年1月，他結算EPS為1.3元，粗略估計當年EPS有望翻番。股東大會於 5 月 18 日召開。 3月12日，證券出借的最後一天還清。截至2月25日，融券餘額4273張。第十九天恢復正常交易，強制收回證券借貸權。 https://money.udn.com/money/story/5607/5297577,0.042483660130718005,0.037459283387622,0.0,0.0,1,0,"TSMC's profit in 2020 reached a record of 19.97 yuan. The annual outlook provided by the Fa said that the revenue in 2021 will still grow 15%, renewing a record high. Reasonable estimation of the profit in 2021 can grow to about 23 yuan. It happens that it happens that it will happen. The price of 679 yuan in the previous high, which is also the highest rate of interest to TSMC nearly 30 times the maximum interest ratio, and then issued a dividend rate of 10 yuan last year. The dividend yield is only 1.47%, let conservative funds no longer chase the price, foreign investment has made high profits. Since the red market, foreign capital has sold over 140,000 pieces, and the significant selling pressure has caused TSMC to fall below the 600 yuan integer level.  However, TSMC has a global leader in the world and the trend has grown. The decline in the stock price has just made the high evaluation moderate amendment. This year's TSMC, with the growth of profit, the dividend may also look at 13 yuan. It is also more reasonable. At that time, the legal person bought the market to buy, and the investment friends would also buy a good buying point to grasp the dividend and price difference.Based on a dividend 13 yuan yield 5%as the benchmark, TSMC's reasonable valuation is 260 yuan, the capital market, the flood of the banknotes of the banknotes, sprayed to 800, look at 1,000, only look at the money, but once the funds retreat, Buffett Buffett once the capital retreats, but Buffett's Buffett retreats, Buffett, Buffett, The theory of ""seeing the naked swimming"" has become a reality. A company with an annual growth force and a leading position in the industry.","On February 25th, London Copper saw $ 9,617 per ton, and rose 21.97%in February. It was $ 300 from the 10,000 yuan integer level. US crude oil came to $ 63.79 per barrel.63%, in the first season of spring restlessness, commodities are winners.  Economic recovery investment main line is active  In a large number of vaccines, the number of people in the United States COVID-19 has declined for six consecutive weeks. The United Kingdom also announced the unseainence of the four stages. I hope to resume normal life before June 21. The world's closure of more than 80 aviation industry. After the Chinese New Year this year, it turned into a strong stock in the stock market. China Airlines and Evergreen Airlines rose +14 last week.72%,+18%, even more surprising that the Yifei.com of the tourist stocks pulled out the five -line board and then rose 19%against the lion. Although the border isolation control cannot be lifted for fourteen days, shareholders can not wait to reflect in advance, Wang Pin, Gourmet-KY, and Holydi have risen simultaneously.  Just after the commodity rose, after the COVID-19 epidemic, the global central bank draft water, and the issue of inflation became the focus of the chairman of the Federal Mascoon.As the vaccine came out, the market's expectations for economic recovery gradually became stronger, and the demand for risk aversion decreased, so that the selling of US public bonds led to an increase in yields.  The phenomenon of rising yields was interpreted by another part of the market as the Federal Subsidies that may raise interest rates in the near future, which caused the stock market to sell pressure. In particular, the crowded technology stocks before the Lunar New Year are the earthquakes. , Coincidentally, the US Securities Regulatory Commission wants to investigate the relationship between Tesla and dog coins, and further drags the popularity of technology stocks. FAANG, AMD, NVDA, QCOM, INTC, MSFT and other major technology stocks have weakened. Biden opposes the monopoly of technology stock giants.TSMC's US factory cost exceeds the standard  So the funds transferred to the production stocks, which caused the semiconductor stocks such as TSMC, MediaTek, and Sun Moonlight after the New Year's popularity. Of course, some reasons were related to the lack of water. Taiwan, where the new crown virus is separated from the other, is separated by typhoons. The next May or June plum -in rainy season will not be resolved to solve the drought. It is estimated that this year will have to save water.However, the lack of water is not urgent. Instead, the US, Japanese, and German car dealers use political forces to closely say that Taiwan's wafer founding factory solves the problem of lack of vehicle chips. I do n’t know how much it affects the gross profit margin?  In addition, Biden also signed an administrative order to solve the problem of core lack. From a long -term perspective, it is natural to build an advanced wafer fabal factory for American businessmen, so it is an inevitable choice to draw a strategic alliance in the short term. TSMC plans to set up the five -nanic factory in the United States will exceed several times more budget. Will the US factory become the burden of TSMC? Formosa Plastics also reversed their losses after years.Since the CEO of Intel's new technology model announced in mid-January that the seven-nanometer process has made significant progress, since the foreign investment has sold super-building electricity, TSMC's stock price has fallen from 679 yuan to 606 yuan, -10.75%has fallen.5 yuan, it seems that the low point of the 591 yuan of the front wave may accept the challenge before removing.  Regarding inflation, the situation facing the United States and China is very different. Last week, the Fed Chairman Ball said at a hearing of the House of Representatives of the House of Representatives for two consecutive days that the US economic recovery was far from being realized, and there was still high uncertainty in the future. He promised that the Fed will maintain a near -zero interest rate to achieve the goal of gently more than 2%for a period of time in inflation, and also stated that it will maintain the purchase speed of existing bonds and mortgage support bonds until the subsequent progress has reached the policy of the Federal Strategy Association's policy. Target.US inflation expectations rise sharply  The tolerance of inflation from the Federal Assembly will be enlarged. For other countries, the pressure of input inflation in disguise, especially China.  Reasons: (1) This round of inflation rate and intensity may be larger than before. In addition to the early stage of the epidemic, the Feds' Association launched all loose measures. The U.S. people's balance sheet not only did not damage, but instead improved significantly. Although the unemployment increased significantly, it directly gave the people a large number of ""money"" loose models. It's right.(2) Leaving aside the reduction of crude oil demand due to the reduction of traffic services (such as aviation and automobiles). In fact, the commodity consumption of American residents is much higher than the level before the epidemic. The increase in the demand for repairing categories has greatly increased, leading to the highest position in the United States for durable wealth consumption in the past 25 years, and the overall commodity consumption inflation level has reached the highest position since 2013.Compared with the financial tsunami in 2008, the United States was slowly repaired at that time, but this round of economic recession, as long as the epidemic prevention and control decrease, the public can go out to ""spend money"", and the demand can be quickly returned to normal Essence  Therefore, although the overall inflation level (PCE) in the United States in December last year was only 1.3%, and the core inflation was only 1.5%. However, the U.S. inflation expectations have been rising sharply. The inflation expectations reflected in the US TIPS recently exceeded 2.2%. The highest record since 2014, the nominal interest rate of the 10 -year public debt in the United States has also exceeded 1.3%.  Now the market is worried that if the actual inflation of the United States has continued to rise, breaking through 2 to 3%, and the rate of improvement of the unemployment population in the United States is not as expected, the Federal Mandrilion will reduce the operation of QE or increase interest rates, and repeat the similar to the late 1970s in the late 1970s. Vicious inflation. Or the speed of tightening the monetary policy is faster than the financial crisis in 2008, which hurts the stock market. Therefore, the Nasdaq index fell 13.42%after the Lunar New Year, which caused the Asian stocks to fall simultaneously last week. 5.43%, Shanghai Stock Exchange Falling 5.06%, Taiwan's weighted drop 2.37%.  History of American commodity trade deficit history  The decline in Hong Kong stocks and land stocks is that the Chinese epidemic is controlled faster than Europe and the United States, and the production side has faster the production side. The proportion of imports from China's imports quickly rose to the level before trade friction. The United States accounts for nearly a quarter of the global terminal demand, and the imports have increased in the short term. The US commodity trade deficit has exceeded the highest point since 2008, and once again reached a record high.At the same time, the US service trade surplus has fallen to the lowest position in the past ten years. The overall trade deficit of the United States has expanded significantly. In fact, it is exporting US dollars and inflation to the world. Because China's export growth rate has continued to rise, GDP has been repaired to normal level, so the People's Bank of China had sacrificed the austerity of currency before the New Year. It is expected that after the two sessions this year, China's monetary policy will stabilize the macro leverage, which means that social merging growth rate will be necessary Tighten the decline and the credit policy will be tightened.Therefore, institutional legal persons have begun to reduce codes for over crowded liquor, medical care, and technology. It is expected that before the end of the first quarter of the financial report, the global stock market will be in the stage of midterm.  Wallopedic capacity lack  The recently tracked rolling stocks — Tianyu In the first three quarters of 2020 EPS, 1.38 yuan, the fourth quarter has grown sharply. EPS throughout the year is 4.07 yuan, mainly benefiting from the support of Sharp wafers in the group. With the current lack of wafer capacity, it maintains performance growth. In January 2002, he settled EPS 1.3 yuan, rough estimation of the year EPS is expected to double.  The shareholders' meeting was held on May 18th. On March 12th, the last day of the securities lending was repaid. As of February 25, the balance of securities lending was 4,273.

145,296,美國大型芯片廠英特爾公司宣布，將押注兩家先進芯片製造商，押注200億美元（約合人民幣5700億元），將芯片供應角色重新帶回美國。路透社報導稱，此舉直接挑戰了目前全球兩大先進芯片製造商台積電和韓國三星電子的地位。英特爾 CEO Pat Gelsinger 週二（3/23）表示，英特爾已經徹底解決了近期的生產技術問題，並強調生產芯片的所有系統都已準備就緒。英特爾將下注200億美元，在原亞利桑那公園新建兩座芯片工廠，預計將增加3000個工作崗位。Gelinen還表示，英特爾計劃在美國和歐洲其他地區設立工廠。 Gelinen 補充說，除了生產英特爾芯片外，這兩家新擴建的工廠還向其他晶圓工程師開放。他表示，新工廠將專注於生產最新的先進電腦芯片。路透社報導稱，英特爾擴產的決定將讓芯片生產重返美國和歐洲，主要是因為美國和歐洲擔心目前的芯片供應過於集中在台積電，以及雙方之間的緊張關係。海峽可能會影響供應。（國際中心/綜合外電報導）-------------------------------- --------------- ---- INTC回歸GG盤後下跌3% 歐洲海豹的機會又來了 還是只能靠運河？,我將在南科建廠。我認為這必須是土地成本的考慮。但絕不能指望台灣島會出現缺水情況 目前世界因氣溫上升經常出現極端氣候 中南部已成為熱帶地區，經常出現高壓氣球天空，所以很難下雨也許梅雨季節可能只在北方最中部地區南方沒有下雨，然後只能在夏季西南季風和颱風下下雨。結果，南方抗議之前一直抗議，所以沒有新的水庫，但用水量已經建好了。竹子脫水也可以依靠運水車來提翡翠水。,0.015100671140939001,0.042483660130718005,-0.033557046979865,0.0,0,1,"Intel Corp, a large US chip factory, announced that it will bet on two advanced chip manufacturers to bet on $ 20 billion (about 570 billion yuan) and re -bring the chip supply role back to the United States. Reuters reported that the move directly challenged the status of the current two advanced chip manufacturers in the world, TSMC and South Korea's Samsung Electronics.  Intel CEO Pat Gelsinger said on Tuesday (3/23) that Intel has completely solved the recent production technical problems and emphasized that all the systems of production chips are ready. Intel will bet $ 20 billion and build two new chip factories in the original Arizona Park, and it is expected to increase 3,000 jobs.Gelinen also said that Intel plans to set up factories in other parts of the United States and Europe.  Gelinen added that in addition to the production of Intel chips, the two newly expanded factories were also opened to other wafer engineers. He said that the new factory will focus on the production of the latest advanced computer chips.  Reuters reports that the decision of Intel's expansion will allow chip production to return to the United States and Europe, mainly because the United States and Europe are concerned that the current chip supply is too concentrated in TSMC, and the tension between the two sides of the strait is likely to affect the supply.(International Center / Comprehensive Foreign Electric Report)  ------------------------------------------------ ----  INTC is back GG fell 3% after the plate The opportunity to be in European seal is here again Or can you only have a canal?","I will set up a factory in Nanke.

149,304,目前，美商外資已經開始拋售台積電，就像紅霞大股東原股東拋售1000多股輕股一樣。那麼拜登會支持一個芯片廠，可能在美國，也可能在大陸（民主黨，尤其是拜登，尤其是大陸），這符合美國和民主黨現在的利益，現在的美國的政策方向發生了變化。特朗普拉著俄羅斯、印度和台灣打大陸，所以支持台灣GG 現在拜登要大幅削減軍費。與二戰時期的美國一樣，亞洲部分與大陸合作對抗俄羅斯。此外，它還支持日本對抗中國和韓國。部分歐洲用德國對付俄羅斯，用英國對付卡特 你聽過猴子和商人的故事嗎？一個商人來到一個小島上。起初，他用10塊錢收購了島上的猴子和人。之後漲價100元，收了200元。島上的猴子越來越少。後來，猴子1000元沒有收到。結果，這位商人說他已經提前回美國了。結果，他的助手出來告訴了島上的人。我用600塊錢偷偷把商人猴子賣給你，商人回來的時候，你卻用1000塊錢賣給他，結果助理賣掉猴子後，商人就再也沒有回到這個島上。目前技術裝備材料都在美國手裡，美國還能用反托賴斯搞GG台灣錯誤的一方支持特朗普。拜登在大陸有很大的職業生涯。做一個芯片廠，在大陸做一個10萬億美元的芯片廠並不難。特朗普在位時，曾用反托萊斯起訴美國科技龍頭股，因為這些公司反對美國對大陸的製裁，禁止在大陸的華為小米購買美國高科技產品。所以不要不要以為美國沒有受到外國公司的製裁。你站在錯誤的一邊崇拜你。民主黨最有可能與大陸合作，在大陸開公司或拿大陸拿下51%的股份，然後支持中芯國際。然後，就像布施伊拉克一樣，你會有一支核軍隊來摧毀你，因為伊拉克偷了石油，侵犯了布施背後石油集團的利益。,這位大神已經成功從500多個預測到650還沒有準確650開始預測已經說過了我說到目前為止從上週五開始我說它又要開始逃離生活的浪潮了很多人不要相信。隨便聽人家聽 就撿起來 以為人家會舉報你 就想讓你自己看 掉到300 看看這個菲律賓挺好吃的 我覺得這個新年估計會輸到畢業 說起大石，擋住了人家的財富，我覺得有人要出去保駕護航了再說說衰落的原因 台積電的體能和實力本身不錯 但是現在的價格已經超太多了，都是外資熱錢再炒作 那麼散戶就是傻子追高散戶，想靠外資贏。你需要說什麼？最後一刀是英特爾的刀。就算最近有車廠，用兩者的差距也太大了，英特爾吃不下這個泡沫，打破了這個泡沫的長期佈局。還有人天真地認為台積電應該有這個價位台積電很強勢，但早在幾年前就已經強勢了。為什麼三月份的價格之前沒有這個價格就開始衝了？ 外資還傻傻的讓大神都傻了 說起大石，封了人家的財富，還以為有人出去護送已經上車的人了能敢下車賺大錢。如果你現在還沒有上車，你必須上車。,0.051696284329563004,0.014308426073131,-0.037156704361873,-0.020667726550079,1,1,"At present, the foreign investment of US business has begun to sell TSMC, just like the original shareholders of Hongxia's large shareholders who sold more than 1,000 light stocks. Then Biden will support a chip factory, which may be in the United States or on the mainland (Democratic Party, especially Biden, especially in the mainland) This is in line with the current interests of the United States and Democratic Party, and the current US policy direction has changed. Trump draws Russia, India and Taiwan to fight the mainland, so he supports Taiwan GG Now Biden wants to significantly reduce military expenses. Like the United States during World War II, the Asian parts and the mainland cooperate to fight against Russia. In addition, it supports Japan to fight against China and South Korea. Part of Europe used Germany to fight against Russia,Use Britain to Carter  Have you ever heard the story of monkeys and businessmen? A businessman came to a small island. At first, he acquired monkeys with 10 yuan and people on the island. After that, the price was raised by 100 yuan, and 200 yuan was collected. There are fewer and fewer monkeys on the island. Later, the monkey was not received at 1,000 yuan. As a result, the businessman said that he had returned to the United States in advance. As a result, his assistant came out and told the people on the island. I used 600 yuan to secretly sell the businessman monkey to you, and when the businessman came back, you were selling it to him with 1,000 yuan As a result, after the assistant sells the monkey,The merchant never returned to this island.  At present, technical equipment materials are in the hands of the United States, and the United States can still use anti -Torais to engage in GG Taiwan's wrong side supports Trump. Biden has a big career in the mainland. It is not difficult to make a chip factory a 10 trillion dollars in the mainland to make a chip factory.  When Trump was in his reign, he used anti -Torais to sue the US technology leading stocks, because these companies opposed the US sanctions on the mainland and It is forbidden to buy US high -tech products in Huawei Xiaomi in the mainland.So don't think that the United States is not sanctioned by foreign companies. You stand on the wrong side to worship you.  Democratic Party is most likely to cooperate with the mainland to open a company in the mainland or take the mainland to take 51%of the stock and then support the SMIC. Then, like Bushi Iraq, you will have a nuclear military army to destroy you because Iraq stole oil and violate the interests of the petroleum group behind Bush.","This god has been successfully predicted from more than 500 predictions until 650 has not been accurate 650 starts to predict that it has been said as I said so far From last Friday, I said that it will start to escape the wave of life again Many people don't believe it.

What do you need to say? The last knife is the knife of Intel. Even if there is a car factory recently, it is useless to use The gap between the two is too large Intel to eat this bubble to break the long -term layout of this bubble.  There are still people who are naive to think that TSMC should have this price TSMC is very strong, but it has been strong as early as a few years ago. Why did you start to rush without this price before the price of March?Foreign capital is still stupid to make gods stupid Speaking of Da Shi, I blocked people's wealth, and I think someone is going out to escort  Those who are already on the car can dare to get out of the car and make a profit.

The market fluctuated with the negotiations. Stocks.  At that time, the market decline was fully in line with Grandpa Paba's ""buying when fear"". The author was convinced that ""the growth investment at the bottom of the value stock"" faced the opportunity of heavenly gifts, planning ahead, and buying trade disputes. Later, it seemed that the original decision was right.At the end of April 2019, the global stock market is immersed in the joy of the US -Land Trade Agreement. Of course, Taiwan stocks are no exception. The weighted index is 11,000 points, the leader of the leader of the leader, and 4,900 yuan in the stock king. Just all the beauty, US President Trump suddenly accused Lu Fang regret the previous agreement, which will raise tariffs and recover justice.  This message caused the global stock market to be turbulent, and Taiwan stocks could not be spared, especially technology stocks. In 20190523 TSMC, Dali Guang fell to 230 and 3800 yuan. The market is extremely concerned.High -tech portrayal of the great light prospects of human beings are insulating, because I do n’t understand things, including investment, I remember that Grandpa Paba teachs “an industry that does n’t invest and does n’t understand.” Full pleasure.Many analysts spread out the rising charts, which are really the most beautiful paintings on the world. The stimulating brain brown sources are endless. Napoleon's defeat does not mean Napoleon's last fate. The stimulus of high -tech stock prices is often the pain that he does not know when it will rise.In 2018, the domestic and foreign legal persons who were bravely bought by the national huge stock price were 1300. They diligently attended the company's law, exhausted their brains and thought about the boss's sincere explanation of the ex -wife's release of stocks and the industrial prospects. , Prove the professional judgment based on the high -end buying at that time. On the surface, it was jade Ruyi, which was itchy. In fact, it was just the heel of the boss's ex -wife brand -name women's shoes. The pain also.Wealth comes from a deep understanding of a steady and deeper understanding, and it is relatively practical in my heart. After penetrating this point, it is completely indifferent to the violence that does not understand the industrial stock price in order to prevent the suffering of violence. A large number of buying and expanding the results of the war, from time to time, check the industry and the company's recent situation, because they are all easy -to -understand industries. You can judge that you don't have to burn your brains.The U.S. -Land Trade War has been confronted for a long time. The uncertainty of the technology industry has established supply chain adjustments for many years. Pick that.  The funds are like tide. If the housing market takes the bottom of the valley, the rise in construction shares will continue. Involved, the risks are not low.Hongsheng's revenue began in June 2018 without the prestige of the previous May. The revenue from this year to April also decreased significantly compared with the same period last year. After this year, it does not issue dividends, and after reducing capital reduction, it has fallen to 19.9 yuan.  Hongye's 2019 revenue has become popular since January. Without the strong buying in the second half of 2018, the stock price has also been greatly amended.  It is said that New Taipei City has reduced the taxation rate of house hoarding, and whether the construction of the builders in New Taipei City slowed down the price to be sold at the price. Whether it is true is also the secret that it cannot be explicit. The biggest risk.  Individual companies may have a big sales and have a rise in regional construction, but after they are sold, they must also face the overall housing market trend. The sales leader Haiyue has not been hot last year this year. No one can recover the prosperity.In the end, the housing market trend is related to the overall economic prosperity, government policies, and taxation systems. Next year, the government policy and tax system of the election cannot change significantly. Now the most likely to change is the overall economic prosperity, which must be planned.Facing the US -land trade war, the overall economic prosperity cannot improve positively. As for the house, the beautiful tulips finally sowed the seeds. Under the blow of the U.S. -Land Trade War, whether it could grow smoothly into a large garden and dispersed the faint aroma. This beautiful scenery is worthy of respect.At present, some construction stocks have a sharp trend and their own themes, but the tide -like funds are ebb. At that time, the housing market will not rise together as the government's tumping economic downturn. The stock price is like Hongsheng.  At this stage, do not envy some of the construction stocks. Instead, pay more attention to the rise at the bottom, but also avoid the stock market that is less affected by the economic dumping of the housing market. Kitai Construction is the target of good conservative funds.  Kitai rose 0.45 yuan on May 27, 2019, closed 12.15 yuan, the market -based construction case ""Kitai Zhongxiao"", 478 pings in the base, about 12,000 pings on the 37th floor (the estimate of the information can not be found). The construction of the building has been completed for many years. The Empire Building of the United States started in 1930 and completed in 1931. The building on the 103 -story building was completed in only 410 days before. It can be seen how much Taiwan ’s construction industry is behind.  I bought Kitai at 11.10 in May 2018. After selling in September 13.1 yuan, the stock price rose to 15 yuan. The market may be disappointed and fell because the company did not intend to sell the whole building. The stock price was low as low as 11 in May 2019.55 yuan.  In recent years, Kitai has only covered ""Kitai Zhongxiao"" and has a mediocre performance. However, the dividend balance policy in the past three years can issue 1, 0.8, 0.The dividend of 6, calculating the yield rate, is also a compassion for long -term investors to keep the cold kiln.  The location of ""Kitai Zhongxiao"" is located at the Taipei Railway Station. The location is excellent. The lease income is very considerable. The conservative estimate is that the average rent per ping of 12,000 pings per ping is 3,000 yuan per ping. 430 million, this revenue and profit growth are very amazing. If the company decides to sell the whole building, it is even more profitable.  Kitai's stock price has been low -end for a long time, and it is difficult to make a sword. How will the future be so price, just wait patiently to wait for the stimulus of the comprehensive Lidu, and harvest the stock price rising."
